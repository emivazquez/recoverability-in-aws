The estimates for the RTO and RPO for the cases of a single AZ outage and a single region outage are the following:
Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is less than a second since the RDS databases in the Multi-AZ configuration, the change from the primary to the standby is automatic.
Minimum RTO for a single region outage is 5 min aproximately because the read replica is not promoted automatically to primary so you can do it with an automatic job or manually.
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is 0 because the primary and standby databases in Multi-AZ configuration replica synchronously, which means that the data that is in the primary is also in the standby.
Minimum RPO fot a single region outage is less than a second because the replication between a primary database and its replicas is asynchronously and therefore there is some latency between one data being uploaded to the primary database and the replica.
